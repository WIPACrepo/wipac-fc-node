# wipac-fc-node
Node.js Client for WIPAC File Catalog

## Motivation
Provide an API for Node.js having feature parity (or is that parody?)
with the [Python API](https://github.com/WIPACrepo/wipac_fc) to talk
with the file_catalog server.

## Building
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After
that is properly installed, proceed with the instructions below.

    cd ~/my-projects
    git clone https://github.com/WIPACrepo/wipac-fc-node.git
    cd wipac-fc-node
    npm install
    node_modules/.bin/cake rebuild

If you would like to see the testing coverage report, you can
also run this command:

    node_modules/.bin/cake coverage
